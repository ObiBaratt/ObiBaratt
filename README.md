## About Me [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/linkedin-%230077B5.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/obibaratt/)

Full-Stack Developer with a biochemistry/pre-med background, startup experience, and a love of learning. 

I made a decision to get into medicine during the Ebola crisis. I saw what Doctors Without Borders was doing, heroes who took on massive amounts of student loans, and spent over 10 years studying were leaving their normal lives to fight a terrifyingly deadly disease far away from home. I wanted to be that kind of person.

After finishing my premed coursework I discovered something when a simple script I made was downloaded and run on the other side of the planet: Programming has reach. One doctor can treat one patient at a time, but code can be run by as many people as want to run it. I saw another path, taking my exposure to Python for scientific data analysis I began digging into the idea of using code for good, seeing it as a tool to uplift people. 

From there I have expanded into the JavaScript and React ecosystems, gaining experience at startups using React, React-Native, TypeScript, JavaScript, Node, Firebase, PostgreSQL, and more. In essence, I'm a problem solver, a creator, and overjoyed to be able to code every day.

## I Enjoy
- Consistent improvement. Sometimes it seems like such a huge amount of effort to improve, but if you keep taking incremental steps towards perfection they quickly add up.
- My hobbies include Powerlifting, Hiking, Reading, and Programming! (Notice a theme?)

## I'm working on
- Freelance software engineering. If you need dev work send a message on my LinkedIn, or book a time on my [Calendly](https://calendly.com/obib/chat).
- Some *really* innovative startups.
