## About Me [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/linkedin-%230077B5.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/obibaratt/)
I made a decision to get into medicine during the Ebola crisis. I saw what Doctors Without Borders was doing, heroes who took on massive amounts of student loans, and spent over 10 years studying were leaving their normal lives to fight a terrifyingly deadly disease far away from home. I wanted to be that kind of person. 

After finishing all my premed coursework I discovered something when I made a simple script that a friend on the other side of the planet was able to download and run: Programming has <em>reach</em>. One doctor can treat one patient at a time, but code can be run by as many people as want to run it. I saw another path, taking my exposure to Python for scientific data analysis I began digging into the idea of using code for good, seeing it as a tool to uplift people.

Set on a new path, I soon realized that programming let me solve problems and make new things all the time! With Life Science research, changes can take <em>years</em>, but in an hour of programming I'll regularly run dozens of experiments!

In essence, I'm a problem solver, a creator, and overjoyed to be able to code every day.

## I enjoy
- Consistent improvement. Sometimes seems like such a huge amount of effort to improve but if you keep taking incremental steps towards perfection they quickly add up.
- My hobbies include Powerlifting, Hiking, Reading, and Programming! (Notice a theme?)
