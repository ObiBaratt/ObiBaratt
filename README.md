# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Obi. Welcome to my profile.

## History
I have a Bachelors of Science in Organic / Biochemistry (minor CS/IT) but decided that the coding aspects
were more interesting than the research! I discovered a love for coding and creating things that has led me to focus on working as a developer.

## I'm currently working on...
1. Workout Web: https://workout-web.herokuapp.com/
a personalized workout app utilized for myself and friends to plan workouts.

2. Monthly meal plan / grocery list / recipe book generator for a startup.

## I plan to work on...

1. Pet memory / memorial page.

## I like to...
Powerlift, program, hike, read, create, and learn new things.
